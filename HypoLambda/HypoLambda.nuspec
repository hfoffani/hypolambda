    <summary>
A small functional programming language for .NET.

Its syntax is based on Python but whitespaces are ignored. Everything is an expression.
The language runtime is embeddable, its AST is accesible and it compiles to portable pcode.
There's an REPL you can play with and the project includes lots of unit tests.

A small functional programming language for .NET.

Its syntax is based on Python but whitespaces are ignored. Everything is an expression.
The language runtime is embeddable, its AST is accesible and it compiles to portable pcode.
There's an REPL you can play with and the project includes lots of unit tests.

Example of factorial:
f = lambda x:
    (x*f(x-1)) if x > 1 else 1;
f(4)
returns 24.0
